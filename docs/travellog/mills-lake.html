          <h1>Exploring Colorado!</h1>
          <p>For about 4 days in July, I went with a couple of friends to Colorado. Over those four days, we did a lot of things, from hiking in the Rocky Mountains, to trying to climb the Manitou Incline, to just enjoying the good weather that Colorado had to offer.</p>
          <p>Overall, the trip was greatly enjoyable, especially after a year and a half of limited outdoor time due to the pandemic. Although Covid regulations were still in place in Colorado, it was nice to enjoy the outdoors and have a little break from the Texas heat.</p>
